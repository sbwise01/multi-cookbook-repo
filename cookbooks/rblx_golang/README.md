## TODO

- Newer Go versions can be installed via `go get`, which create a binary called `go#{version}`. Add `goget` as an install method with an option to alias the binary (ie point `go` => `go#{version}` after moving `go` => `go#{oldversion}`).
- Add an attribute to replace an old version for binary/source installs
